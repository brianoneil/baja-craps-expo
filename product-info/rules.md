Rules: 
- A user gets a point if they roll a 7 or 11 on their roll if there is no established number.  When the player gets a point from this they then start over with no established number and it remains their turn.
- A user can "Crap Out" if they role a 2,3, or 12 on their role if there is no established number.  When a user "Craps Out" they do not lose a point but the turn changes to the next player.  The next player does not receive a point.
- If there user doesn't role 7 or 11 and if they don't role 2, 3, or 12 when no number is established then the number they have rolled becomes the established number.  
- Once there is a established number, the user must roll that same number again to get a point.  If they roll a 7 before they role that number again then the turn changes to the next player and neither player receives a point.  If they role the established number then the user gets a point and the number resets to no established number.
- Points are applied by either adding a point to the leading player if they score a point or taking a point from the leading player if the non-leading player gets the point.
- The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score.
- The score should not go below 0.  When the score is 0 then the next player to get a point takes the lead and becomes the leading player
